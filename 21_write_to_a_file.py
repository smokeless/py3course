'''
Take the code from the How To Decode A Website
exercise (if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to play with
some different code, use the code from the solution),
and instead of printing the results to a screen,
write the results to a txt file.
In your code, just make up a name for the file you are saving to.

Extras:

Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
