Exercise 23 (and Solution)

Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them,
find the numbers that are overlapping. One .txt file has
a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt
file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t
be divided by any other number. And yes, happy numbers
are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia.
The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)
